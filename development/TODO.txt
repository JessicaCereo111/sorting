* Get Sorting::Helpers#asc and #desc properly documented. Same for Sorting and Kernel.
  The code below did not work, but might help in a future attempt.

    # Convenience method to create a Sorting::Ascending instance.
    # Works exactly the same as {Sorting::Ascending#initialize}
    # @!parse def asc(*args, &lazy); end; module_function :asc

    # Convenience method to create a Sorting::Ascending instance.
    # Works exactly the same as {Sorting::Ascending#initialize}
    # @!parse def desc(*args, &lazy); end; module_function :desc

* More examples in the documentation
